===================
First Alpha
1) Command executor responds with messages

3) Format costs into arrays [{Money, 10000},{19:0,100}] to cost 10,000 money and 100 sponges.
4) Proof of working with economy (perhaps a special chest where item payments can be taken)
5) Reads and writes global variables to config.yml

Second Alpha
Add World Guard Region functionality
1) Define a 20x20 (configurable) region centered at command location
2) Flag the region for no-PVP and no MobSpawn
3) Define 5x5 sub-regions with Restaurant and Hospital flags
4) Create border push mechanism
5) Cost mechanism applied to all these changes
